# Shopping Cart App

### *A React JS shopping cart app with typescript that also has front-end routing to view an individual product.*
I created this project to put the things I acquired during my internship into practice.

[Live Demo](https://shopping-cart-react-ts-redux.netlify.app/) 
## Tech Used
- HTML/CSS/JS (Typescript)
-  React JS
-  React Router
-  React Redux
-  React Testing Library (RTL): Check branch [testing-w-RTL](https://github.com/AlkTheOrg/ts-shopping-cart/tree/testing-w-RTL)
## Afterthoughts
- At first, statically typing a React app using Typescript was odd, but I now consider myself fortunate that my internship team was using it. It demonstrated how powerful a React app can be.
- Althoug we didn't use Redux (or Router, which I already knew) on the project, I tried to study it whenever I could because it is commonly used on other React projects. 
	- Its logic is similar to Context API but was harder to grasp (especially with TS). When I figured it out, I understood how strong it is at prop management.
	- This project was later converted to Redux (First version was made in the first week of my internship). The [commit history](https://github.com/AlkTheOrg/ts-shopping-cart/commits/main) can be viewed. 
- I still have a lot to learn about React as well as other technologies. <s>Testing the React apps is one of my next steps. I probably am going to come back to this project to practice my testing skills</s> (**Did with RTL. Will do with Enzyme as well.**).
